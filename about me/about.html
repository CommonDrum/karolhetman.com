    <a>I’m Karol Hetman. With a strong foundation in computing science and physics from the University of Aberdeen, I’ve cultivated a passion for algorithmic problem-solving, operating systems, and object-oriented programming. My proficiency extends to the GNU/Linux environment, evident from my hands-on experience with bash scripting and Kron. Proudly, I’ve earned the “TOTAL: CompTIA Network+ Certification (N10-007)”, and I’m well-versed in cloud computing and dockerization.

        In the professional realm, I’ve had the privilege to serve as an IT Admin Intern at SID Group SA, overseeing company servers and addressing IT concerns. Additionally, my role as a Cybersecurity Compliance Intern at EY allowed me to delve deep into firewall configurations and fortify internal security protocols. A firm believer in teamwork, I’ve effectively collaborated using the Scrum Agile framework, championing efficient project workflows. Dive into my portfolio to explore my journey and accomplishments in detail.</a>
